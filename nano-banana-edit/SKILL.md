  Edit images with Google Nano Banana 2 (image-to-image edit endpoint)
  on RunComfy — bundled with the model's documented prompting patterns
  so the agent gets sharper output than naive prompting against the
  same model. Knows Nano Banana Edit's strengths (preserve subject
  identity, swap background, localize edits with spatial language,
  multi-image batch edits up to 20 inputs), the schema, and when to
  route to GPT Image 2 edit / Flux Kontext / Nano Banana 2 t2i instead.
  Calls `runcomfy run google/nano-banana-2/edit` through the local
  RunComfy CLI. Triggers on "nano banana edit", "edit with nano banana",
  "image edit nano banana", or any explicit ask to edit with this model.

# 🍌 Nano Banana Edit — Pro Pack on RunComfy

[runcomfy.com](https://www.runcomfy.com/?utm_source=skills.sh&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=nano-banana-edit) · [Edit endpoint](https://www.runcomfy.com/models/google/nano-banana-2/edit?utm_source=skills.sh&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=nano-banana-edit) · [GitHub](https://github.com/agentspace-so/runcomfy-skills/tree/main/nano-banana-edit)

Google **Nano Banana 2 Edit** — the image-to-image edit endpoint of the Gemini-family flash-tier image model — hosted on the **RunComfy Model API**. Up to **20 input images per call** for batch edits and multi-reference variation.

**This skill bundles the model's documented prompting patterns** — preservation-first language, spatial scope localization, batch consistency, sibling-routing — so the agent gets the model's strongest output on the first or second try, instead of burning credits on prompts the model wasn't going to nail.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add agentspace-so/runcomfy-skills --skill nano-banana-edit -g
```

## Why this skill (vs calling the model raw)

A bare `runcomfy run google/nano-banana-2/edit --input '{"prompt":"...","image_urls":["..."]}'` runs, but you'll spend several iterations relearning what the edit endpoint actually responds to. This skill packs that knowledge in:

- **Preservation-first language** — start the prompt with what to **keep** (identity, pose, brand, framing), then state what to change. The model holds composition stable when told what NOT to touch.
- **Spatial scope localization** — "background only", "remove the left object", "change shirt color only" beats "make it cyberpunk". Narrower scope = sharper edit.
- **Batch consistency** — pass up to **20 source images** in `image_urls`. Lock `aspect_ratio` and `resolution` across the batch so outputs feel like a series, not a grab-bag.
- **Iterative refinement** — if edits drift, **reduce scope and iterate** in multiple short prompts rather than piling up one long edit instruction.
- **Web-grounding for current-event edits** — `enable_web_search: true` when the edit references something fresh.
- **Sibling routing** — when Nano Banana Edit wins (preserve identity + scope-targeted edit, batch-consistent edits) vs when GPT Image 2 edit / Flux Kontext / t2i beat it (multilingual text editing, single-shot precise local edits, generating from scratch).

The agent calling this skill gets the model's strongest output on the first or second iteration — same model, sharper result.

## When to pick this model (vs siblings)

| You want | Use |
|---|---|
| Preserve subject identity, swap background or clothing | **Nano Banana Edit** ✓ |
| Edit up to 20 images consistently in one batch | **Nano Banana Edit** ✓ |
| Localize edit to "X only" with spatial language | **Nano Banana Edit** ✓ |
| Edit multilingual text inside the image (signs, labels) | GPT Image 2 edit |
| Single ref + precise local edit ("she's now holding X") | Flux Kontext |
| Generate a new image from scratch | Nano Banana 2 t2i (sibling skill) |

If the user said "nano banana edit" / "edit with nano banana" explicitly, route here regardless.

## Prerequisites

1. **RunComfy CLI** — `npm i -g @runcomfy/cli` or `curl -fsSL https://runcomfy.com/install.sh | sh`
2. **RunComfy account** — `runcomfy login` opens a browser device-code flow.
3. **CI / containers** — set `RUNCOMFY_TOKEN=<token>` instead of `runcomfy login`.

## Endpoints + input schema

### `google/nano-banana-2/edit`

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `prompt` | string | yes | — | Edit instruction. Lead with preservation, end with the change. |
| `image_urls` | array | yes | — | **1–20** publicly-fetchable HTTPS URLs. |
| `number_of_images` | int | no | 1 | 1–4 outputs per call. |
| `seed` | int | no | — | Reproducibility. |
| `aspect_ratio` | enum | no | `auto` | `auto` (follows input) or fixed ratios — lock for batch consistency. |
| `resolution` | enum | no | `1K` | `0.5K` / `1K` / `2K` / `4K`. |
| `output_format` | enum | no | `png` | `png` / `jpeg` / `webp`. |
| `safety_tolerance` | int | no | 4 | 1 (strict) – 6 (permissive). |
| `limit_generations` | bool | no | — | If true, restricts each round to one output. |
| `enable_web_search` | bool | no | false | Web grounding (extra cost / latency). |

## How to invoke

**Single-image background swap, identity preserved:**

```bash
runcomfy run google/nano-banana-2/edit \
  --input '{
    "prompt": "Keep the subject identity, pose, and clothing unchanged. Convert the background into a rainy neon cyberpunk street.",
    "image_urls": ["https://.../portrait.jpg"]
  }' \
  --output-dir <absolute/path>
```

**Batch edit with locked framing:**

```bash
runcomfy run google/nano-banana-2/edit \
  --input '{
    "prompt": "Replace the watermark in the bottom-right with the text \"AURA\" in clean white sans-serif. Keep everything else exactly as in the input.",
    "image_urls": ["https://.../sku-1.jpg", "https://.../sku-2.jpg", "https://.../sku-3.jpg"],
    "aspect_ratio": "1:1",
    "resolution": "1K"
  }' \
  --output-dir <absolute/path>
```

**Targeted spatial edit ("left object only"):**

```bash
runcomfy run google/nano-banana-2/edit \
  --input '{
    "prompt": "Remove the leftmost object only. Keep the right two objects, the table, and the lighting unchanged.",
    "image_urls": ["https://.../still-life.jpg"]
  }' \
  --output-dir <absolute/path>
```

## Prompting — what actually works

**Preservation first, change last.** Always lead with `"Keep [identity / pose / clothing / brand / framing] unchanged."` Then state the change in one clean sentence. Models honor what's stated up front; tail-end preservations get ignored.

**Localize with spatial language.** "background only", "the left object", "the upper-right corner", "above the headline" — concrete spatial scopes are honored. "make it more X" is vague and drifts.

**Batch consistency** — when editing a series, lock `aspect_ratio` and `resolution`. Use the same prompt grammar across the batch so each output reads as a sibling, not a remix.

**Iterate small.** If a one-pass edit drifts, split into two: pass 1 changes background only, pass 2 swaps the subject's outfit. Cleaner edits, same total cost (assuming similar resolution).

**Multi-image variation** — pass up to 20 inputs to get a coherent batch. Useful for SKU galleries, A/B testing, character sheet variations.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Long compound instructions ("change A and B and C and D") — drift increases per added scope.
- Edit instructions written in passive voice ("the background should be changed") — be imperative.
- Missing preservation goals — model will subtly rewrite the face / brand.
- Aspect ratios that don't match input — causes crops or stretches.

## Where it shines

| Use case | Why Nano Banana Edit |
|---|---|
| **SKU gallery — same product on different backgrounds** | Batch of 20, identity-preserved, framing locked |
| **Influencer / spokesperson background swaps** | Strong identity preservation across edits |
| **Localized object removal / addition** | Spatial language honored |
| **A/B variants for ad creative** | Seed lock + multiple `number_of_images` |
| **Brand-asset relocalization** | Same composition with text / palette swap |

## Sample prompts (verified to produce strong results)

**Background swap (page example):**

```
Keep the subject identity unchanged. Convert the background into a rainy
neon cyberpunk street.
```

**Targeted text replacement:**

```
Keep the bottle, label, and lighting exactly as in the input.
Replace only the brand text on the label from "ALPHA" to "AURA",
same font weight, centered, white on black.
```

**Multi-image batch consistency:**

```
For each input image: keep the subject's pose and identity unchanged.
Convert the background to a soft warm-grey studio sweep with subtle
floor shadow. Center the subject at the same fraction of frame as the
input.
```

## Default behavior for the calling agent

- **Lead with preservation goals in the prompt.** If the user said "swap the background", rewrite as "Keep [the subject + everything in the foreground] unchanged. Swap the background to X." Pass the rewritten prompt — but only if rewriting for clarity, not adding intent.
- **Use `aspect_ratio: auto`** to preserve input ratio unless the user explicitly wants reframing.
- **Pick `resolution` by intent.** Drafts → `0.5K`. Default → `1K`. Final → `2K`. Print / hero → `4K`.
- **Use `number_of_images > 1`** when the user asks for "options" or "variants".
- **Always pass `--output-dir`.** Deliver the file(s).

## Hard constraints

- Don't switch models without permission. If user said "Nano Banana Edit", don't substitute GPT Image 2 edit, Flux Kontext, or any other.
- Don't rewrite the prompt's INTENT — you may rewrite for clarity (preservation-first ordering), never for content change.
- Don't ask for unsupported aspect ratios / resolutions.

## Limitations

- **1–20 input images per call** — the first is treated as primary; the rest provide auxiliary cues.
- **1–4 outputs per call.**
- **Long compound prompts drift** — split into multiple passes.
- **Web search adds latency + cost** — only enable on demand.
- **For multilingual in-image text edits, GPT Image 2 edit wins.**

## How it works

The skill invokes `runcomfy run google/nano-banana-2/edit` with a JSON body matching the schema. The CLI POSTs to `https://model-api.runcomfy.net/v1/models/google/nano-banana-2/edit`, polls the request, fetches the result, and downloads any `.runcomfy.net`/`.runcomfy.com` URL into `--output-dir`. `Ctrl-C` cancels the remote request before exit.

## Security & Privacy

- This skill only invokes the `runcomfy` CLI. No other endpoints, no telemetry, no callbacks.
- The token saved by `runcomfy login` lives at `~/.config/runcomfy/token.json` (mode 0600).
- Auto-download is restricted to `*.runcomfy.net` / `*.runcomfy.com` — a compromised model cannot trick the CLI into pulling arbitrary internet content.
